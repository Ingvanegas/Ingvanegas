# Hi, I'am Wally

 I am from Barranquilla, Colombia and a systems engineer, passionate about programming and decided to build stuff that makes us feel that we are on another level. I can give your Company all my 7 years of experience developing software, in addition to my enthusiasm and desire to do it. All in the best way, I can carry on my shoulders the responsibility of being in a useful member of your company.
